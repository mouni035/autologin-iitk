# Autologin IITK :: CIPH3R

## Introduction

`autologin-iitk` is a Python script designed to automate the login process for IIT Kanpur's firewall authentication page. This script continuously checks for the captive portal, performs login, and keeps the session alive to maintain internet connectivity without manual intervention.

## Motive

- Servers and most of the computers in labs are connected via LAN and require login to the Firewall page at every boot. To automate this process, this script was created.
- Sometimes, for certain PCs, we might need to connect to **iitk** WiFi only, again for which the firewall page is necessary. Hence, `autologin-iitk`.

# Setup and Installation

    git clone https://github.com/cipherswami/autologin-iitk.git
    ```

- Now, edit the `autologin-iitk.py` file in the **src** folder to add your username and password:

## MacOS

### Installation

- 🥲🤣 I'm not rich enough to afford Apple products. You guys, please find a way to install the below command as a service or simply put it as a startup command:

    ```sh
    python path-to-script/autologin-iitk.py
    ```

### Uninstallation

- Simply undo what you did 😜.

## Additional Info:

- The script is designed to self-terminate after 3 Hrs in the case of failures or when you are already connected to internet beyond refresh time (2 Hrs).

- There is a possibility of a maximum downtime of 15 minutes in case reboots are involved, as it doesn't store the last authentication instance. 

- In such cases, you can restart the service:

  - **Linux**: 
    - In bash terminal execute - `service autologin-iitk restart`
  
  - **Windows**: 
    - In powershell execute - `Restart-Service -Name "autologin-iitk" -Force` (or) you can do it from `services.msc`
